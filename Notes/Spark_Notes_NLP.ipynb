    "## Tokenization \r\n",
    " - Tokenization is the concept of splitting a document or sentence into small subsets of data that can be analyzed.\r\n",
    " - Tokenization can be performed by word or sentence\r\n",
    "  - To tokenize by sentence, you would provide a document with at least one sentence. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Normalisation \r\n",
    "- Normalisation is taking misspelled words and converting them into their original form \r\n",
    "- It helps get the text to a readable forma and allows us to create other use cases on top of it. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Stemming \r\n",
    "- Removes the suffic from a word and reduce it to its original form\r\n",
    "- e.g. To reduce \"horses\" to \"horse\" and \"ponies\" to \"poni\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Lemmatisation \r\n",
    "- Removes the sufix from a word and reduces it to its origical form\r\n",
    "- Tends to be a smoother cut off the end of the word\r\n",
    "  - Tries to return to the original root word \r\n",
    "- Lemmatisation always returns a real word \r\n",
    "- e.g. \"am\" --> \"be\" \r\n",
